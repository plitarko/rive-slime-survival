# Rive Slime Survival Game

This is a game I built over the course of a few days using the canvas-advanced Rive runtime.
It's partially based on this example: https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/rive-canvas-advanced-api-centaur-example-exh2os?file=%2Fsrc%2Findex.ts

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` and start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
